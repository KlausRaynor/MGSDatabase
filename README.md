Metal Gear Database Project

###About
This project will be a (HEAVILY WIP) faithful recreation of the Metal Gear Solid Database software found on the Playstation 3 home console.  

More to be added to this README when more features are added, but as for now, it is very barebones (finished for a project).

When complete, expect a fully interactive Javascript/PHP based web application to fully explore the intricate details of the [Metal Gear Solid] saga.
